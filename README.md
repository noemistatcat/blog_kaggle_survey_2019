## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
All the analysis and visualizations do not require any special installation. All the libraries are available in Anaconda distribution (using Python 3).

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This is my first major exercise for the Data Science Nanodegree Program in Udacity (Write a Blog Post). 
I chose this topic because it is very relevant to someone like me who wants succeed in the Data Science field. 
Here are the key questions I wanted to answer:
1) Are there major differences in salary among the different data science roles?
2) What are the essential technical skills to do well in data science?
3) Does educational background play a huge part?
4) How much does continuous learning on online platforms help?
To answer my questions I used the [2019 Kaggle ML and DS Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019).

## File Description <a name="files"></a>
The main analysis and data exploration can be found in the Jupyter Notebook (Winning in the Data Science Field.ipynb). 

The raw data for the survey is also included (multiple_choice_responses.csv).

For a quick glance at all the questions included in the survey, this file is useful: questions_only.csv

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The whole article can be found through a Medium post publicly available through [this link](https://medium.com/@noemiramiro/how-to-win-in-the-data-science-world-fdb0bd9b4ce7?source=friends_link&sk=b38fc9052e192db75fac94d2d00a0346) 

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>
I'm grateful to Udacity for enabling me to write my first blog post. Thanks also to Kaggle for being an awesome source of free datasets. Lastly, big thanks to my fianc√© Paul Tang for proofreading my article and providing valuable inputs.
